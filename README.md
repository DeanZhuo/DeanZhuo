- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DeanZhuo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Mobile App Development using C# Xamarin.Forms (now MAUI)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of function in Xamarin Cross Platform (now MAUI), including UWP. 
Currently I'm not doing in depth setting and testing in iOS platform, as I don't have the devices needed yet.
Now that MAUI has released globally, and Xamarin only supported until November 2023, I'm learning MAUI and moving my Xamarin project to MAUI!
